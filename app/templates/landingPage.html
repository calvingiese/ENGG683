              ImmiGreat is a Software Subscription company that focuses on supporting immigrants in their transition to life in Canada. Moving to a new country already presents many challenges but using our software will make the process of calling it home much easier. We offer features that help people make connections with others who have experienced the immigration process, support videos documentation for unfamiliar items like getting a driver’s license.

                  The tier 2 subscription helps our users

              <p>My biggest fear with starting my new journey in Canada was thinking I would have to go it alone.
                I had so many questions but no idea where to find the answers.
                When I finally came across the ImmiGreat platform I felt a great wave of relief wash over me.
                Through it, I was able to connect with experts in all areas of the immigration process to ensure I was taking all the right steps.
                I now had so many resources within my reach to guide my way when uncertainties were sure to arise.
                The services provided by ImmiGreat have made a lasting positive impact on my ability to settle into my new home. </p>

              <p>Before joining ImmiGreat, I struggled to find a community of others who understood the unique experiences I was facing with my move to Canada.
                I wanted to be able to share the struggles and joys of my daily life with others, and come together with them to further explore this new environment.
                When I was recommended the ImmiGreat Community platform I was skeptical at first, but through it I have met many caring people who I am now lucky to call my friends.
                I now have a network of support to aid in navigating me through all the surprises that come with living on the other side of the world from where I grew up.” </p>
